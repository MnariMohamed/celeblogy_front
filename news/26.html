     <h1>'World of Dance PH': Crossover favorite to advance to division finals amid drama</h1>
<article>
   <img src="pictures/262.jpg">
   <p>It has been said, countless of times, that the road to success can be filled with bumps and cracks. </p>
   <p>One such obstacle almost came in the way of Crossover, which had to deal with the emotional strain of the possibility of losing a member ahead of their "The Cut" performance. </p>
   <p>They revealed that one of their members begged out of the group as he needed time to find a job and take care of his pregnant girlfriend --a request the rest said no to. </p>
   <p>In a touching show of solidarity, the group told this member that they'll pitch in to solve his financial problems and that they'll adjust practice schedules to give him the personal time he needs. </p>
   <p>The result was a spirited performance --the best of Saturday's episode, earning them 91.7 points from the judges, the highest score of the Team Division round of "The Cut" so far. </p>
