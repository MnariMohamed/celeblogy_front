    <p>Cillian Murphy has revealed that he ditched vegetarianism after 15 years so he didn't look like a "skinny Irish fella" when he took on the role of Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. </p>
    <p>The actor spoke to <a href="https://www.mrporter.com/journal/the-look/mr-cillian-murphy-toughens-up/1857?cm_mmc=LinkshareUK-_-TnL5HPStwNw-_-Custom-_-LinkBuilder&amp;ranMID=36586&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-YnMLNuDBGkj6aQ3qCms7xQ&cm_mmc=PartnerizeAPAC-_-independent-_-True+Content-_-1011l12799&setupsession=false" target="_blank">Mr Porter</a> where he explained that a personal trainer suggested he took up eating meat to help "bulk up" for the first series in 2013. </p>
    <p>"I was vegetarian for about 15 years. But it was never a moral decision," he said. "It was more that I was worried about getting mad cow disease.</p>
    <p>Gillen's casting follows swiftly on from the announcement that Adrien Brody will also star in the new series.</p>

    <p>Show creator Steven Knight commented: "We have a dream team gathered for series four of Peaky Blinders, coming to us for love of the series which is great.</p>
    <p>"Adrien Brody, Aidan Gillen and Cillian Murphy give us a wealth of talent to work with. And with Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley returning, we couldn't have hoped for more."</p>
    <p>The fourth series of Peaky Blinders is filming now and is expected to air in early 2018.</p>
