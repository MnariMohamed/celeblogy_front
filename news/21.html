    <p><strong>"You were my best friend, sister, motivator and person that could make me laugh until I cried."</strong></p>
    <p>That was the message from Phoebe Tomlinson, whose older sister Felicite was found dead last week at the age of 18</p>
    <p>Felicite, the sister of One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson, was an aspiring fashion designer who had 1.3 million followers on Instagram.</p>
    <p>Felicite and Louis lost their mum Johannah to leukaemia in 2016.</p>
    <p>Daisy and Phoebe Tomlinson, who are 14 and twins, paid tribute to their sister on Instagram.</p>

    <p>"Mummy needed you and you desperately needed her," Phoebe wrote.

Both sisters talked about their mum in their tribute posts.

Daisy said: "Mama needed you. I hope you are happier up there with her.

"I have two angels now, watching over me."</p>

<p>Scotland Yard said police were called by London Ambulance Service at 12:52 on Wednesday 13 March to a residential address following reports of a woman having a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>"A female believed to be aged 18 was pronounced dead at the scene," the statement said.</p>
<p>It added: "A post-mortem examination will take place in due course."</p>
<p>A person who was with Felicite called 999, according to The Sun newspaper.</p>

<p>Louis released a song earlier this month which was inspired by the grief he felt over his mum's death. It includes the lyrics: "I'll be living one life for the two of us."</p>
<p>"It was something I needed to get off my chest," the 27-year-old told Radio 1 Newsbeat at the time.</p>
<P>"I used to lean on my mum for a lot of things - anytime I needed advice on something she would be the first call I made."</P>

<p>The Doncaster native said playing the song to his sisters for the first time was "tough" because he "didn't want them to get caught up in the sadness".</p>
<p>But, he said, "as their big brother if I can sing those words it'll hopefully help them too".</p>
