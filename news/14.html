    <p>They began dating in 2015 and welcomed their daughter, Lea, two years later. </p>
    <p>And Bradley Cooper, 44, and his girlfriend <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/irina-shayk/index.html" target="_blank">Irina Shayk</a>, 33, looked the picture of happiness as they enjoyed a day out with their little girl on Thursday afternoon.</p>
    <p>The couple have been plagued by rumours that Bradley was having a tryst with his A Star Is Born co-star <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/lady_gaga/index.html" target="_blank">Lady Gaga</a>, following their entrancing duet at the Academy Awards last month.</p>
    <p>However they quashed rumours of any strife between them, by sporting beaming smiles as they sat in the sunshine during a glorious day in LA.</p>
    <p>Irina cut a relaxed figure in a loose-fitting white sweatshirt and swept her brunette locks up into a neat bun, while sporting a simple chain around her neck.</p>
    <p>The model showcased her natural beauty by going make-up free for their outing, proudly showcasing her glowing complexion as she cosied up to her family.</p>

    <p>Bradley also opted for a casual look, sporting a denim blue shirt with a pair of black slim fit jeansm complete with a pair of black and white trainers.</p>
    <p>He sported a spattering of signature stubble and wore his hair in an care-free fashion, as he was pictured looking down adoringly at his daughter Lea, one.</p>
    <p>Last month <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/lady_gaga/index.html" target="_blank">Lady Gaga</a> dispelled claims she was having an affair with Bradley after their steamy Oscar performance of their tune Shallow ignited speculation. </p>
