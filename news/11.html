    <p>Ben Affleck is beyond grateful to be in a good place again.</p>
    <p>On Thursday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the actor, 46, opened up about how his life has changed for the better following a rocky few months that saw him return to rehab for continued treatment in his ongoing battle with alcoholism.</p>
    <p>After remarking that Affleck, who’s been promoting his new Netlix movie Triple Frontier, hadn’t been on the show in two years, DeGeneres acknowledged that “a lot has happened” since then.</p>
    <p>“You look healthy and happy and I’m happy for you,” the 61-year-old television host added.</p>
    <p>“There’s temptation to get like — I could depressed, I could be like, ‘I’ve been through a lot. This was hard, this was hard,’ or I could be kind of embarrassed,” Affleck said, addressing his hardships. “But I have to say, I feel so good right now,” Affleck said.</p>
    <p>“I’m in such a great place, the kids are healthy, life is good. So whatever it took for me to get to this place, I’m grateful for,” he added.</p>

    <p>In October, Affleck revealed he’d completed a 40-day stay at a treatment center in an emotional statement on Instagram.</p>
    <p>“Battling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle. Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment. It is full-time commitment. I am fighting for myself and my family,” he wrote. “As I’ve had to remind myself, if you have a problem, getting help is a sign of courage, not weakness or failure. With acceptance and humility, I continue to avail myself with the help of so many people and I am grateful to all those who are there for me. I hope down the road I can offer an example to others who are struggling.”</p>
    <p>The Oscar-winning actor previously entered rehab in 2001, and, years later, announced he had completed treatment for alcohol addiction in March 2017.</p>
    <p>Earlier this month, the actor spoke candidly on the Today show about his ongoing battle with alcoholism and how it has affected his family with ex-wife Jennifer Garner.</p>
    <p>“Being an alcoholic, it’s part of my life, it’s something that I deal with,” Affleck told Hoda Kotb. “It doesn’t have to subsume my whole identity and be everything, but it is something that you have to work at.”</p>
    <p>He continued, “I hope I’m a pretty good dad. I certainly try very hard. I’m lucky they got a great mom, and she helps out a great deal with making sure that we co-parent in as good a way as possible.”</p>
    <p>Affleck and his ex-wife continue to work together to co-parent their children Violet, 13, Seraphina, 10, and Samuel, 7. The actress, 46, also helped Affleck get the help he needed last summer when she took him to a treatment facility in August.</p>

    <p>A source close to Affleck recently told PEOPLE that the Triple Frontier star’s health has been on the upswing.</p>
    <p>“Ben is doing great,” the insider said. “Of course life has its challenges. He focuses on the kids and making sure he is present.”</p>
    <p>Affleck has also rekindled his romance with Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, who attended the Triple Frontier premiere with him in New York City last week. They’d broken up in August just before Affleck went to rehab for the third time, but started seeing each other again earlier this year.</p>
    <p>Triple Frontier is out on Netflix.</p>
