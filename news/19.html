     <h1>What Neil Patrick Harris Thinks About A How I Met Your Mother Revival</h1>

    <p>How I Met Your Mother ended just four years ago, but that hasn't stopped anyone from asking the show's cast whether or not they'd be up to return for a revival of the CBS sitcom. Neil Patrick Harris was recently asked his thoughts about the show making a comeback and the actor left no one in suspense on where he stood on the idea. Harris admitted he hadn't thought much about the series since its ending, but that he didn't see a reason to return to the series:<strong>I really just look back on that chapter with great fondness. I just don't feel like there's anything left to do, really. I miss the players within it. I miss the writing staff and Pam Fryman, who directed all of those shows. It was fun to get to play with the same actors every week, but right now I'm knee-deep in Snicket and those are some bony knees.</strong></p>
    <p>Neil Patrick Harris made it clear that his unwillingness to entertain the idea of a How I Met Your Mother revival at this point has nothing to do with his time on set. In fact, Harris spent a bulk of his comments talking about the great time he had working with the show's cast and staff over those eight years. As fun as working on the set of the series was, however, Harris told TVGuide he's too busy with A Series of Unfortunate Events to even think too long about reviving the old show, which is understandable. Harris also threw in there he thought Carter Bays and Craig Thomas did a good job wrapping up the series' story in Season 9, so why go back to it?</p>
    <p>Neil Patrick Harris' second statement regarding a How I Met Your Mother revival series has to sting a bit for quite a few fans of the show, as the final season is sometimes viewed as a polarizing end to an overall satisfying series. Harris' opinion on the show's finale doesn't just differ from some of the show's fans or even some of his castmates like Alyson Hannigan, who is on record with saying she had problems with the series finale. Unfortunately, the series will need more than just Hannigan's opinions to get a continuation/revival/reboot, and without Barney Stinson on board, it doesn't sound like that's going to happen anytime soon.</p>
    <p>Neil Patrick Harris could always change his mind, and with A Series of Unfortunate Events only set to last one more season, there's always hope he may feel differently about a How I Met Your Mother revival after that. Fans can hope that anyway, as Harris' unwillingness to return to play Barney Stinson may not just hamper the hopes of a revival, but could also make any crossover appearances in that potential spinoff unlikely. Hopefully Harris has a change of heart, as a revival or just one more episode of How I Met Your Mother has the potential to be Legen... wait for it... dary.</p>
    <p>How I Met Your Mother is currently streaming on Hulu. For a look at some new shows coming to television in the near future, visit our midseason premiere guide.</p>
