    <p><strong>London</strong>: Singer Zayn Malik says he always feels like he is trying to work through "whatever certain issues are around certain subjects".</p>
    <p>His anxiety issues led to the cancellation of several gigs last month. </p>
    <p>In a behind the scenes video from his Vogue cover shoot, Malik, 24, has hinted that he is still struggling with the condition, reports dailymail.co.uk. </p>
    <p>He said: "I always feel like I'm trying to work through whatever certain issues are around certain subjects. For me personally, it comes from a place of not wanting to come across as an over-arrogant person that takes themselves too seriously."</p>
    <p>The former One Direction star added that he "is not always trying to be pretentious or say something that is going to change the world, I feel like I'm one voice among millions." </p>
    <p>Malik also said that despite being an international pop star, he struggles to mix with other people. </p>
    <p>"I'm not a very outgoing social person like in terms of a big group of people. You know when we're getting ready to put the second album out, people are going to start seeing me a bit more. I'm excited for what people will think and I think it's been a year since I properly showed my face and stuff." </p>
