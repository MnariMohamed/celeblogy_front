    <p><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong> and <strong>Ariana Madix</strong> are moving on up!</p>
    <p>The two lovebirds no <a href="https://twitter.com/ariana2525/status/988588512558510080" target="_blank">longer have to turn off their air conditioner</a> in order to use the microwave in their West Hollywood apartment, because they just purchased a $2 million home. Talk about a major upgrade!</p>
    <p>Sandoval's longtime friend Douglas McFarland of ReDesign Real Estate and Design says helping his pal find his dream home"was a really great experience for us to share together."</p>
    <p>McFarland tells E! News, "Tom has always looked as me as his secret weapon when it comes time to buy a house. We explored a lot of options in a lot of different areas (both fixers and new) and ultimately found that the quality and detail of this property was far superior than your typical turn and burn mc-mansion."</p>
    <p>The $2 million home features five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms. Even better? Madix and Sandoval will soak up the sun come spring and summer because their mansion features an outdoor pool complete with a waterfall (OKUR). </p>
    <p>It's a farmhouse-style property full of charm, which is the complete opposite vibe of the reality TV personality's TomTom bar.</p>

    <p>Douglas shares the couple has "big plans for interior design/decor, including building out a bar for Tom." </p>
    <p>The house is located in the Studio City/Sherman Oaks area, which isn't too far of a trek to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/lisa_vanderpump" target="_blank">Lisa Vanderpump's</a> restaurants.</p>
    <p>"It's still hard to believe that this actually happened," Tom's longtime friend says. "Suffice to say, this means a lot to me and I'm probably a bit more emotional of this one than normal. I can't put into words how proud I am of Tom and how much he deserves this for himself!"</p>
    <p>It's only a matter of time before the Vanderpump Rules cast joins the couple for some lavish parties. Let's hope they capture it all on camera.</p>
