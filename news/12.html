    <p>The newest luxury mall in New York City opened on Thursday — and Anne Hathaway joined in on the fun.</p>
    <p>The Oscar winner, 36, stepped out for the private opening of Hudson Yards alongside her husband Adam Shulman, 37. The two were pictured laughing as they took in the new buildings on the west side of Manhattan.</p>

    <p>Hathaway looked stylish and casual in a floor-length white dress under a trendy blazer while Shulman sported a black blazer with a blue button-up shirt and black jeans.</p>
    <p>Though the couple are often seen together, Hathaway and Shulman keep their private life with 2-year-old son Jonathan out of the public eye</p>
    <p>But the actress took the time to praise her hubby while promoting Serenity — a dark thriller where she played a domestic abuse victim.</p>
    <p>“I thought I was doing a good job of keeping myself safe and in my life,” she told PEOPLE at the film’s premiere in January. “And then by the end, it had just taken over. I’m just really grateful I had my husband there to remind me where our life ended and where she began, and helping to keep that clear for me.”</p>
