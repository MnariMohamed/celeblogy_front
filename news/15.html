<p><strong>Shocking: Kate Garraway has revealed she is desperately trying to get in touch with relatives in New Zealand, following multiple mosque attacks in Christchurch</strong></p>
<p>As she and co-host Charlotte Hawkins reported on the then-breaking attack, Kate said: 'It's utterly cowardly but it points to a horrific bravado that they would do that and I think it is just disgusting. Everyone is shocked and the people of Christchurch are.</p>
<p>'I'm sure many of you at home will have relatives in New Zealand and it will be very alarming for you. Friends there.'I've got relatives and friends in Auckland and Christchurch myself that I'm trying to get in touch with.</p>
<P>'So we will definitely make sure that we keep you posted on everything that is happening there.'</P>
<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Good Morning Britain for more information. A representative for Kate declined to comment to MailOnline. </p>

<p><strong>Horrendous: It comes after two gunmen opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch on Friday afternoon - Thursday night in the UK - with one live-streaming the attack on Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Of the 49 fatalities, 41 were killed at the Al Noor Mosque and seven at the Linwood Avenue mosque. Three were outside the mosque itself. A 49th died in hospital.</p>
<p>A further 48 people were rushed to Christchurch Hospital with gunshot wounds, 20 in a critical condition. </p>
<p>Police Commissioner Mike Bush has now confirmed in a statement that four people have been arrested, and one 'man in his late 20s' has been charged with murder to appear in court on Monday. </p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Friday's terror attack was 'one of New Zealand's darkest days.'</p>
