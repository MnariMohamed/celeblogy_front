<div class="pfirst">
<p>
    As 2018 comes to a close, there have been so many celebrities who completely dominated all year long, giving us new music to stream, new movies to check out, and exciting gossip for us to devour.
    </p>
    <p>
From whirlwind celebrity engagements, marriages, and splits like Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and surprise births from Kylie Jenner, it's been a wild year for celebrity news.
</p>
<p>
Here are 21 celebrities who dominated the headlines this year.

   <h2>Kylie Jenner revealed she gave birth to baby Stormi after keeping fans guessing and also topped Forbes' list of highest paid celebrities.</h2>

        For the past decade, nearly every single thing the Kardashian-Jenner family does has made headlines, but in 2018, it was all about Kylie.<button id="1" style="background: none;">..see more</button>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The youngest Jenner sister started off the year by announcing that she'd given birth to her first baby, Stormi with partner Travis Scott, after keeping her pregnancy a secret from the public for the latter part of 2017.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a heartfelt <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeycUmgFTWb/" target="_blank">Instagram post</a> on February 4, Jenner apologized for keeping fans "in the dark" and not sharing details of her pregnancy, later sharing a touching video documenting her pregnancy and Stormi's birth with fans.
    </p>
    <p>
        She then shared glimpses of her life as a mom, all the while dominating the beauty industry by expanding her namesake line, Kylie Cosmetics. The brand has amassed Jenner a $900 million fortune, landing her the top spot on Forbes' highest-paid celebrities of 2018, all before Jenner's 21st birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the year, Jenner and Scott have sparked engagement and marriage rumors, which she hasn't confirmed nor denied, but with 2019 right around the corner, we have a feeling we'll need to continue keeping up with Kylie.

        In November, she released "thank u, next," her first #1 single and revealing that she was working on new music. In December, she was named Billboard's Woman of the Year, addressing her rollercoaster year with the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        In her acceptance speech, Grande said, "I find it interesting that this has been one of the best years of my career and the worst of my life," alluding to her career successes and relationship challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        In May, she began dating Pete Davidson after announcing that same month that she'd split from longtime partner Mac Miller. Grande and Davidson had a whirlwind romance that resulted in an engagement and a breakup over the course of five months.
    </p>
    <p>
        In September, Miller died as a result of an apparent drug overdose at the age of 26.

        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking with People magazine, the mom of two revealed, "Until recently I lived in denial and isolation and in constant fear someone would expose me. It was too heavy a burden to carry and I simply couldn't do that anymore. I sought and received treatment, I put positive people around me and I got back to doing what I love — writing songs and making music."

        <p>
            In November, she released her 15th studio album, "Caution," to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/music/caution/mariah-carey" target="_blank">critical acclaim</a>, topping the charts.

    <p>Though she became a household name in 2017, we'd be remiss not to call 2018 the year of Cardi. The rapper started the year out by surpassing Beyoncé on the charts, becoming the first woman to have five Top 10 singles simultaneously on the Hot RB/Hip-Hop songs chart in January.<button id="10" style="background: none;">..see more</button>

She enjoyed solo success as well as collaborative success with artists like Bruno Mars, Bad Bunny, J Balvin, Taki Taki, Maroon 5, Rita Ora, DJ Snake, and Selena Gomez, reminding us all that it's Cardi's world and the rest of us are just living in it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In April, she announced she was pregnant with her first child, a daughter named Kulture that she gave birth to in July. Cardi shared the first photo of Kulture in December, a day after announcing she'd split from husband Offset, after having <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8462548/cardi-b-offset-married" target="_blank">confirmed she was married</a> in June.
        </p>

            The rapper made headlines after a public feud with Nicki Minaj, and in November, released her first clothing line with Fashion Nova, which sold out online within hours of its debut.
